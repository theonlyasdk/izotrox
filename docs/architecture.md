# Izotrox UI Architecture

## Views

Views are the top-level UI elements that are displayed on the screen. They are the main entry points for the user to interact with the application.

## Widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of the UI. E.g Button, TextBox, ListBox, Label, Layout, etc.

## Container

Containers are widgets that can hold other widgets. They do not have an inherent layout but can be used as a base for creating new layouts.

## Layouts

Layouts are used to arrange the widgets in the UI. A layout is a container, which is a widget.
