1. the root view should not have a focus rectangle shown
2. widgets should only register clicks on mouse up
3. when mouse down, check for scrolling of layouts first
4. Minimum font size for all standard widgets is 18.0 pts, store this in res/theme/default.ini under [System] as FontSize and use it in main.cpp where the font is loaded.
5. Also do the same for font family , under [System] have a FontFamily key and set its value to a path such as res/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf. Implement a string_value() function if needed in ThemeDB
6. Widgets should unfocus after clicking outside or on another widgets
